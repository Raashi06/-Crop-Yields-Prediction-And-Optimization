README
🌾This project delivers a comprehensive end-to-end solution for crop yield prediction and optimization, structured into two key phases:

An in-depth comparative analysis of eight machine learning–based regression models

The development and evaluation of a GRU-based deep learning model

The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of conventional machine learning approaches and benchmark them against a deep learning framework capable of learning temporal and sequential patterns in agricultural data.
